# Security Policy

## Hi, I'm Eli (@biblicabeebli), maintainer of the Beiwe Platform.

I've got a good handle on security writ large, but this is a team of mostly just me so your support is appreciated. I welcome any such reports.

If you have any security items to report, please email me at my dedicated contact for items related to this platform, biblicabeiwe@gmail.com.  I will try to respond quickly.


## Before Reporting

If your report is a suggestion about how to improve security, particularly via a configuration change to one of our supported runtime platforms, please post that as an issue on the github repository.  Enhancements to existing deployments may require additional detail or safety checks as they will not necessarily be handled or applied by serious system administrators.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please make your subject line clearly state that it is about a possible security issue on the beiwe-backend (or other) repo.  If there is a CVE to look up please make that prominent in your email.

I will respond to your communication as soon as possible.  I will only discard communications that appear to be spam or clearly AI-generated.


## Version support
The Beiwe Backend is a rolling release with no version number.  There is no legacy support beyond upgrade guides, fixes and patches will be applied to the current release.
