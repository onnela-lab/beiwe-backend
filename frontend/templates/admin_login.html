  <h2>Welcome to the Beiwe App Website</h2>
  <p>Beiwe is a smartphone application that functions as a data collection platform. Unlike the large majority of
    commercially available applications, Beiwe is intended for biomedical research. Our primary activity in this area
    is the development of statistical learning methods and software for analyzing and modeling data collected from
    Beiwe. Our initial application areas of digital phenotyping are psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, where
    we aim to generate new outcome measures and social and behavioral biomarkers that can be used in diagnostication
    and monitoring of these disorders. Our work in Digital Phenotyping is primarily supported by an NIH Director’s New
    Innovator Award made to Dr. Onnela. Here is the HSPH <a
      href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/jp-onnela-wins-nih-directors-new-innovator-award/"
    >Press Release</a>.</p>
  <p>Progress in medical science has always been driven by high quality data. A longstanding barrier to progress, both
    in clinical settings and research trials, has been the fundamental difficulty of accurately measuring the human
    phenotype, including but not limited to physical mobility, gross motor activity, speech production, behavioral
    patterns, and social engagement. Smartphones are now ubiquitous and can be harnessed to offer medicine a wealth of
    data on the human phenotype. Subjects can be instrumented using dedicated scientific apps that generate continuous
    streams of behavioral data. This approach has enormous potential, but data alone are not enough: the data need to
    be coupled with appropriate statistical learning tools in order to fully leverage their potential. Only then can
    these data be transformed into clinically valid and useful information, the kind of information that can transform
    research and discovery and, ultimately, patient health.</p>
  <p>We have coined the term <b>digital phenotyping</b> to refer to the <i>moment-by-moment quantification of the
      individual-level human phenotype, in situ, using data from digital devices</i>. It is enabled by the combination
    of rich behavioral data from personal digital devices and appropriate statistical learning methods. Human behavior
    is also context specific, which is why we believe characterizing behavior <i>in situ</i>–life as lived and
    experienced by people in their everyday surroundings–is critical. Our understanding of the human genotype has been
    revolutionized in the past two decades, but there are at present many areas of medicine where some of the most
    important challenges lie in characterizing the associated human phenotype. This is where Digital Phenotyping comes
    in.</p>
